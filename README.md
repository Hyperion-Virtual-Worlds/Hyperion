# Hyperion Virtual Worlds

Welcome to Hyperion Virtual Worlds!

Hyperion Virtual Worlds is the new name for the open-source project arm of Virtual World Research Inc.  The purpose of the project is to allow members of the open-source community and virtual world owners and users to collaborate with the developers and staff at Virtual World Research Inc. on creating the Open Source or Community version of A Galaxy Beyond Virtual World System.

Hyperion Virtual is a next-generation grid server and viewer system that has been designed from the ground up as a whole new way to do virtual worlds. The system is designed from the research of a number of extremely experienced people that are deeply rooted in the virtual world and virtual reality design. Other VW systems were carefully analyzed such as SL, OpenSim, Halcyon, SilverSim, WhiteCore-Sim, Aurora-Sim, Hi Fidelity (the original), Sine/Space, IMVU, Minecraft, and a number of others. We came to the conclusion that we could do virtual worlds better!

This led to the creation of a company to handle the business end of things called Virtual World Research Inc. Our group consists of 25+ people who are vitally interested in building a better virtual world.
